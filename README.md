I made this project with Arduino Uno, HC-05, L298N H-Bridge, DC motors, jumper wires, servo, a 9V battery, a 5V USB power bank, resistors and a breadboard. 
The car frame and DC motors came from a solar powered car toy.
The H-bridge controls the back DC motors, the servo controls the steering and the HC-05 gives it remote control. The 9v battery powers the H-bridge and the power bank powers the Arduino.
The app was made in MIT App Inventor, I have added the apk and aia file.
